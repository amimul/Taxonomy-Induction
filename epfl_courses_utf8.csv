Voies de circulation,CIVIL-406,"Traffic facilities as road, airport and railtrack are bases of transport networks. Component selection and application of design methods used to build and maintain efficient structures on the life cycle."
Water and wastewater treatment,ENV-405,"This course on water and wastewater treatment shows how to implement and design different methods and techniques to eliminate organic matter, nitrogen and phosporous from wastewater, and how to apply physical and chemical methods and techniques to produce drinking water."
Water quality modeling,ENG-400,"This course builds on environmental chemistry and microbiology taken in previous courses. The emphasis is on quantification using the public domain package, PHREEQC, which is an excellent computation tool. Numerous applications are investigated during the course."
Water resources engineering,ENV-424,"Water resources engineering designs systems to control the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water to support human demands and the needs of the environment. "
Wave propagation along transmission lines,EE-575,"In this lecture, we will describe the theoretical models and computational methods for the analysis of wave propagation along transmission lines. "
Wind energy,ETH-432,
Wireless receivers: algorithms and architectures,EE-442,"The students will learn about the basic principles of wireless communication systems, including transmission and modulation schemes as well as the basic components and algorithms of a wireless receiver. They develop an understanding for the wireless channel and the performance and limitations."
"Wood structures, properties and uses",MSE-466,"The presentation of tree growth and formation of wood anatomical structures, linked to the description of specific physical and mechanical properties, makes it possible to understand the different forms of utilisation of this material, including aspects of sustainable development"
